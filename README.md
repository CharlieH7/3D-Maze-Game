# 3D-Maze-Game
A 3D Maze Game Created in Unity for my year 12 Major Project in SDD

Language used: C# and a little bit of GLSL

The background and the scenery was made using unity's block which I referred from watching this tutorial:

I watched some YouTube tutorial on how to improve my prototype by adding a background music
and a game menu and how to make the wall solid, so when the character collide the wall does not
see through.

Make sure to download the whole 3D Maze Folder then put it in the unity editor

Open the Unity Editor and export it to .exe so you can run by just double-clicking it.

Have fun!!
